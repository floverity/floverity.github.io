I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at the Australian National University, co-supervised by [Yoshihiro Maruyama](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/yoshihiro-maruyama/) (Australian National University) and [Nicola Gambino](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Nicola.Gambino/) (University of Manchester).

My research interests centre on type theory and categorical logic.

Presently, I am thinking about categorical semantics for a particular kind of modal type theory. 

Previously, I worked on applications of type theory, specifically to the problems of
* formal semantics for natural language, and
* trust in the outcome of electronic vote counting for elections.
